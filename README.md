# House Price Prediction Using PyTorch

This project builds a **House Price prediction model** using **PyTorch**. The model takes various house features (e.g., size, number of rooms, location) as input and predicts house prices using a regression approach.

## ðŸ“Œ **Project Overview**
- **ðŸ›  Framework:** PyTorch  
- **ðŸ“Š Task:** Regression (predicting continuous values)  
- **ðŸ“‚ Dataset:** Contains house features and corresponding prices  
- **ðŸ§  Model:** Fully connected neural network  
- **ðŸ“ˆ Training:** Optimized with different activation functions and hyperparameters  

## ðŸš€ **How It Works**
1. **Loads and processes the dataset**: Standardizes the data for better model performance.  
2. **Trains a neural network using PyTorch**: A deep learning model is trained to minimize error.  
3. **Evaluates performance based on loss reduction over epochs**: Monitors learning progress.  
4. **Provides predictions for new data**: The trained model can predict house prices based on input features.  

This project explores various model architectures and tuning strategies to improve accuracy.
